║                   HOW TO SET ACADEMIC YEAR AS ACTIVE                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:

1. Go to Dashboard > Settings > Academic Years

2. Click on "Create New Year" button (on the left side)

3. Fill in the form:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ACADEMIC YEAR:     2026                                     │
   │ START DATE:        Jan 01, 2026   (Use date picker)        │
   │ END DATE:          Dec 31, 2026   (Use date picker)        │
   │                                                             │
   │ ☑ Set as Active   ← CHECK THIS BOX!                        │
   │                                                             │
   │ [Create Year Button]                                        │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. THE IMPORTANT PART:
   ✓ Check the checkbox "Set as Active" BEFORE clicking Create
   ✓ This makes 2026 the current active year
   ✓ Only ONE academic year can be active at a time
   ✓ When you activate a new year, the previous active year becomes inactive

5. Click "Create Year"

6. You'll see the year appear in "All Academic Years" section with:
   - Status: Shows if it's ACTIVE, PENDING, or COMPLETED
   - Dates: Shows the start and end dates


HOW IT WORKS:

Active Year = Current School Year
├─ Students enrolled in this year
├─ Classes created for this year
├─ Terms defined for this year (Term 1, 2, 3)
├─ Fees apply for this year
└─ Used for current reports

Inactive Year = Future or Past Year
├─ Can be used for planning
├─ Students can be promoted to this year
└─ Can be made active later


EXAMPLE:

2025 (Completed)  ← Previous year (inactive, all students graduated)
2026 (Active)     ← Current year (classes, students, fees active HERE)
2027 (Pending)    ← Next year (ready for students to promote to)


CHANGING THE ACTIVE YEAR:

1. When current year ends (Term 3 completes):
   - Create new year (2027)
   - Check "Set as Active"
   - Click Create
   
2. 2026 automatically becomes "Completed"
3. 2027 becomes the new "Active" year
4. Students promoted from Grade 1→2, etc. go to 2027


VISUAL INDICATOR ON SCREEN:

All Academic Years
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2026 (Jan 01, 2026 - Dec 31, 2026)         │
│ Status: ACTIVE ← Your current year!        │
│                                            │
│ 2027 (Jan 01, 2027 - Dec 31, 2027)        │
│ Status: PENDING ← Ready for next year      │
│                                            │
│ 2025 (Jan 01, 2025 - Dec 31, 2025)        │
│ Status: COMPLETED ← Past year              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘


IMPORTANT REMINDERS:

⚠️  Only create ONE active year at a time
⚠️  Set as Active BEFORE clicking Create
⚠️  Can only progress to next year when current year's Term 3 is completed
⚠️  Active year is shown at top: "Current Year: 2026"
⚠️  All new classes/terms created under the active year


If you don't check "Set as Active":
- Year is created as PENDING
- No students can enroll until you manually activate it
- You'll need to go back and activate it later
