# 🎯 QUICK FIX SUMMARY - Student Balances Not Showing After Rollover

## What Was Wrong
The Student Management page showed **$0.00 balances** for all students after rollover, even though the system had correctly created `StudentBalance` records with proper amounts.

## What Was Fixed
Updated 3 files to read student balances from the `StudentBalance` model instead of deprecated Student fields:

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `core/models/student.py` - Updated `current_term_balance` property
2. ✅ `core/views/student_views.py` - Updated balance filtering & detail view
3. ✅ `core/views/dashboard_views.py` - Updated dashboard statistics

## To See the Fix

### Option 1: Quick Restart (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop your server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again:
python manage.py runserver
```

### Option 2: Verify the Fix Works
```bash
python verify_balance_fix.py
```

This will show you that balances are now correctly reading from the database.

## What You Should See Now

**Before Fix:**
- Outstanding: $0.00
- Arrears: $0.00

**After Fix:**
- Audrey Buwa: Outstanding $1,200.00 (unpaid)
- Noah Buwa: Outstanding $670.00 (with $70.00 arrears from previous term)

## Why This Happened

The system was using **two different data sources**:
- ✅ Database stored correct data in `StudentBalance` model
- ❌ Display layer was reading from deprecated `Student` fields (not updated after rollover)

Now they're both using the same source: `StudentBalance` model.

## Testing

Run this to verify data:
```python
from core.models import Student
student = Student.objects.first()
print(f"Balance from property: ${student.current_term_balance}")
```

You should see a non-zero balance that matches the StudentBalance record.
