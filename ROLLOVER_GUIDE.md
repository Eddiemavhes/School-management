## 🔄 HOW THE ROLLOVER WORKS

### Fixed Classroom Model
```
Physical Classrooms (Permanent):
├── Grade 1A (reused every year)
├── Grade 1B (reused every year)
├── Grade 2A (reused every year)
├── Grade 2B (reused every year)
...

Student Progression:
Grade 1A (2025) → Grade 2A (2026) → Grade 3A (2027) → ...
```

### The Rollover Process

**Step 1: Pre-Rollover Setup**
- ✅ Set **Third Term 2025** as current term
- ✅ Activate/confirm 2026 exists with all classes
- ✅ Create/activate First Term 2026

**Step 2: Execute Rollover**
- For each student currently in Grade X, Section Y:
  - Move to Grade X+1, Section Y in next year
  - If Grade 6: Mark as graduated

**Step 3: Post-Rollover Setup**
- Set **2026** as the active academic year
- Set **First Term 2026** as current term
- Grade 1 classrooms ready for new student admissions

## 📝 NEXT STEPS FOR YOUR SCHOOL

**Your system is correctly configured!**

Current setup suggests:
1. You have ONE student (Noah John) already in Grade 2A (2026)
2. All physical classrooms for 2026 are pre-created
3. System is ready for additional students

To proceed:
1. **Admit new Grade 1 students** to 2026:
   - They'll be assigned to Grade 1A or 1B
2. **Promote existing students** when needed:
   - Use the Bulk Promotion feature
3. **At end of 2026**:
   - Repeat rollover to create 2027, promote students to 2027

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue**: Students not in 2025?
- **Answer**: They're already in 2026 (pre-promoted or data initialized that way)
- **Action**: Normal. Start admitting new students to 2026 Grade 1

**Issue**: Can't promote students?
- **Check**: Next academic year exists and has all grade classrooms
- **Action**: All checks pass in your system!

**Issue**: Wrong dates in academic years?
- **Note**: Dates show 2026-12-31 to 2027-01-01 (should be full year)
- **Fix**: Can be corrected in admin if needed
